Hello, world!

Welcome to your new single-page application, built with:

    ASP.NET Core and C# for cross-platform server-side code
    Angular and TypeScript for client-side code
    Bootstrap for layout and styling

To help you get started, we've also set up:

    Client-side navigation. For example, click Counter then Back to return here.
    Angular CLI integration. In development mode, there's no need to run ng serve. It runs in the background automatically, so your client-side resources are 
	dynamically built on demand and the page refreshes when you modify any file.
    Efficient production builds. In production mode, development-time features are disabled, and your dotnet publish configuration automatically invokes ng build 
	to produce minified, ahead-of-time compiled JavaScript files.

The ClientApp subdirectory is a standard Angular CLI application. If you open a command prompt in that directory, you can run any ng command (e.g., ng test),
 or use npm to install extra packages into it.
